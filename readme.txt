== Description ==

You can select alternative menus to theme locations for showing only to the logged in members. 
Plugin is creating a new **members only** theme location for every theme location you have. 
When you assign a menu to this new locations, it replaces to original menus for members.
For example: You want to show a menu to members only but you dont want to show anything to visitors: Just keep original theme location empty and assign your menu to **(Members Only)**. 
Thats it :)
